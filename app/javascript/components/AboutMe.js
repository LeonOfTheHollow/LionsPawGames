    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m here to kick ass and make games and I’m all out of ass.</p>
    <p>In the late 2010s I cut my teeth as a technologist designing and implementing escape room props in Portland, OR: a little woodworking, a little soldering, and a lot of one-off C++ firmware for Arduino and ESP8266 microcontrollers. Then I worked (for a fair few years) at Amazon, on the web technology powering their newly-instated Amazon Pharmacy division – but somewhere in that expanse of serverless cloud infrastructure and post-sprint meetings I decided the FAANG life wasn’t for me.</p>
    <p>I had a brief stint in fin-tech, which wasn’t for me either, and now I’m back to wandering along the side of the ol’ Information Superhighway, searching for inspiration and hopefully making something all my own.</p>
    <p>When I’m not on the computer, I enjoy complicated tabletop games (Kingdom Death forever), Japanese motorcycles (Suzuki Boulevard rider), obscure movies (have you seen Sorcerer), and going to the beach (Pensacola is a hidden gem).</p>
