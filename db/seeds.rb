    text: 'Once, a master gave a wrong Zen answer and became a fox for five hundred lives.\n'\
    'A student asked him, “is a Buddha subject to the law of causality?” He said, “No.” For his impertinence he was made into a fox.\n'\
    'Many years later, an old man was seen in attendance at Hyakujou’s lecture, though he was not known to any of the monks.\n'\
    'After the monks had left, he came to Hyakujou and said, “Once, I was the master of this monastery, but I gave a wrong Zen answer and was made into this fox. Will you say a good word and free me from this fox’s life? Is a Buddha subject to the law of causality?”\n'\
    'Hyakujou said, “A Buddha is no different from the law of causality.” At these words, the old man was enlightened.'\
    '“I am emancipated,” said the old man, with a deep bow. “Still, I must leave my body in my dwelling-place behind the mountain. Please, perform my funeral as a monk.”\n'\
    'Then the old man disappeared.\n'\
    'Hyakujou put out word in the monastery to prepare for a monk’s funeral. The monks whispered to each other, “Why? No one is in the infirmary.” Hyakujou called them, and led them behind the mountain, and with his stick poked out the corpse of a fox from behind a rock.\n'\
    'Hyakujou performed the funeral rites for the fox. That night, he spoke to his students and told them this story about causality.\n'\
    'One especially perceptive student said, “I understand that some time ago a master gave a wrong answer to a Zen question and became a fox for five hundred rebirths. But what if some modern master were to always give right answers, and never a wrong one? What should become of him?”\n'\
    'Hyakujou said, “Come here, close to me, and I will tell you.” The student approached — then slapped the master’s face, for he knew this was the answer his teacher intended to give him.\n'\
    'Hyakujou clapped his hands and laughed joyfully at his student’s discernment.\n'\

    text: 'Gutei raised his finger whenever he was asked a question about Zen. A boy attendant began to imitate him in this way. When anyone asked the boy what his master had preached about, the boy would raise his finger.\nGutei heard about the boy’s mischief. He seized him and cut off his finger. The boy cried and ran away. Gutei called and stopped him. When the boy turned his head to Gutei, Gutei raised up his own finger. In that instant the boy was enlightened.\nWhen Gutei was about to pass from this world he gathered his monks around him. "I attained my finger-Zen," he said, "from my teacher Tenryu, and in my whole life I could not exhaust it." Then he passed away.',

His hands grasp no branch, his feet rest on no limb, and under the tree another person asks him: "Why did Bodhidharma come to China from India?"\nIf the man in the tree does not answer, he fails; and if he does answer, he falls and loses his life.\nNow, what shall he do?"',
    mumon_commentary: 'Kyogen is truly a fool\nSpreading that ego-killing poison\nThat closes his pupils’ mouths\nAnd lets the tears stream from their dead eyes.'

Only Maha-Kashapa smiled at this revelation, although he tried to control the lines of his face.\nBuddha said: "I have the eye of the true teaching, the heart of Nirvana, the true aspect of non-form, and the ineffable stride of Dharma. It is not expressed by words, but especially transmitted beyond teaching. This is what I have given to Maha-Kashapa."',
